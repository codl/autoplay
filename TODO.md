Planned features
----------------

*  Make it work in non-consume mode too
*  Switch between autoplay and stats-only mode while running

Ideas
-----

*  Other autoplay modes such as

   Oldies goodies : Add tracks with a decent karma that have not been played in a long time

   Discovery : Add tracks with very low add counts and play counts.

   Flawless : Add tracks with karma > 0.95

*  Separate the stats core from autoplay. This way more small tools can be built around it.
